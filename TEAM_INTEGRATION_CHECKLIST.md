## Common Conflict Resolution Guide

### ðŸ”§ Server.py Conflicts
When multiple people modified Server.py:

1. **Create modular structure**:
```python
# In main Server.py, replace individual routes with:
from routes.tasks import tasks_router
from routes.leave import leave_router  
from routes.chat import chat_router
from routes.notifications import notifications_router

app.include_router(tasks_router, prefix="/api/tasks")
app.include_router(leave_router, prefix="/api/leave")
app.include_router(chat_router, prefix="/api/chat")  
app.include_router(notifications_router, prefix="/api/notifications")
```

### ðŸ”§ Database Schema Conflicts
1. **Document all collections**:
   - List existing collections
   - List new collections each person added
   - Check for naming conflicts
   - Merge similar collections if possible

2. **Create migration script**:
```python
# migration.py
def migrate_database():
    # Add new collections
    # Update existing schemas
    # Create new indexes
    pass
```

### ðŸ”§ Frontend Route Conflicts
1. **Update main routing**:
```jsx
// In App.jsx or main router
<Route path="/tasks/*" element={<TaskManagement />} />
<Route path="/leave/*" element={<LeaveManagement />} />
<Route path="/chat/*" element={<ChatInterface />} />
<Route path="/notifications/*" element={<NotificationCenter />} />
```

### ðŸ”§ Package Dependency Conflicts
1. **Merge package.json**:
   - Combine all dependencies
   - Resolve version conflicts
   - Test for compatibility issues
   - Update lock files

## Testing Protocol

### ðŸ§ª Individual Feature Testing
Each person should test their feature works independently:
- [ ] All API endpoints respond correctly
- [ ] Database operations work
- [ ] Frontend components render properly
- [ ] No console errors

### ðŸ§ª Integration Testing
After merging branches:
- [ ] All features work together
- [ ] No API endpoint conflicts
- [ ] Database operations don't interfere
- [ ] UI components display correctly
- [ ] WebSocket connections stable

### ðŸ§ª Performance Testing
- [ ] Application startup time acceptable
- [ ] API response times maintained
- [ ] Database query performance
- [ ] Frontend rendering performance

---

## Rollback Plan

### ðŸ”„ If Integration Fails:
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Switch back to individual working versions
   - Document what went wrong
   - Create backup of attempted integration

2. **Alternative Approach**:
   - Try merging features one at a time
   - Focus on backend integration first
   - Test each merge thoroughly

3. **Last Resort**:
   - Manual code comparison and merging
   - Create new clean integration branch
   - Start integration process again

---

## Communication Protocol

### ðŸ“ž During Integration:
- Daily standup calls to discuss progress
- Immediate notification of any blocking issues
- Share screenshots of successful feature integration
- Document all conflicts and resolutions

### ðŸ“§ Required Updates:
- Daily progress reports
- List of completed integration tasks
- Any issues encountered
- Request for help if stuck
