# Enhanced Task Notification System Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive task notification system implemented for the E-Connect platform. All the requested notification types have been successfully integrated into the existing system.

## âœ… Implemented Notification Types

### 1. Task Creation â†’ Creation Confirmation
- **Function**: `create_task_creation_notification()`

- **Recipients**: Manager (confirmation) and assignee
- **Message**: Includes assignee name, task title, and assignment details

### 3. Task Updates â†’ Update Notifications with Changes
- **Function**: `create_task_update_notification()`
- **Trigger**: When task details are modified via `edit_the_task()`
- **Recipients**: Task owner and stakeholders
- **Message**: Lists specific changes made (status, priority, due date, description)

### 4. Subtask Assignment â†’ Individual Subtask Notifications
- **Function**: `create_subtask_assignment_notification()`
- **Trigger**: When subtasks are added to existing tasks
- **Recipients**: Task assignee
- **Message**: Details about the new subtask and who added it

### 5. Comments Added â†’ Real-time Comment Alerts
- **Function**: `create_comment_notification()`
- **Trigger**: When comments are added to tasks

- **Recipients**: Task assignees and managers
- **Message**: Shows days overdue with urgency indicators

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Hierarchy-based Notification System
The task completion notification system now implements a role-based hierarchy:
- **Employee â†’ Manager**: When an employee completes a task, their manager is notified
- **Manager â†’ HR**: When a manager completes a task, all HR personnel are notified
- **Role Detection**: Automatically determines user role from database (`position` field)
- **Multiple HR Support**: Notifies all users with HR role/department for manager task completions
- **Enhanced Metadata**: Includes notification hierarchy type for audit and filtering

### Database Integration
- All notifications are stored in the `Notifications` collection
- WebSocket integration for real-time delivery
- Metadata tracking for comprehensive filtering and reporting
- New metadata fields: `assignee_role`, `notification_hierarchy`

### Key Files Modified
1. **Mongo.py** - Added all notification functions and integrated with existing task operations
   - New helper functions: `get_hr_users()`, `get_user_role()`
   - Enhanced `create_task_completion_notification()` with hierarchy logic
   - Updated URL mappings for HR task notifications
2. **Server.py** - Added new API endpoints and updated existing task endpoints
3. **notification_automation.py** - Enhanced deadline and overdue checking with new notifications

### New API Endpoints
```
POST /tasks/{taskid}/comments         - Add comments with notifications
POST /tasks/{taskid}/subtasks         - Add subtasks with notifications
POST /tasks/test-notifications/{taskid} - Test all notification types
POST /tasks/trigger-deadline-reminders - Manual deadline reminder trigger
GET  /tasks/{taskid}/notification-history - View task notification history
GET  /tasks/notification-summary      - System-wide notification summary
```

### Enhanced Existing Endpoints
- `POST /add_task` - Now sends creation notifications
- `POST /manager_task_assign` - Now sends assignment notifications
- `PUT /edit_task` - Now sends update notifications based on changes
- `POST /task/{taskid}/files` - Now sends file upload notifications

## ðŸš€ Features

### Smart Notification Logic
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Prevents spam by checking for recent similar notifications
- **Stakeholder Detection**: Automatically identifies relevant recipients
- **Context-Aware Messages**: Personalized messages based on user roles and relationships
- **Priority Escalation**: Dynamic priority based on urgency and importance

### Real-time Delivery
- WebSocket integration for instant notifications
- Background task processing to avoid blocking API responses
- Retry mechanisms for failed deliveries

### Comprehensive Tracking
- Full audit trail of all task-related notifications
- Metadata storage for advanced filtering and reporting
- Notification history per task and per user

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring and Testing

### Test Endpoints
- `/tasks/test-notifications/{taskid}` - Tests all notification types for a task
- `/tasks/trigger-deadline-reminders` - Manually trigger deadline checks
- `/tasks/notification-summary` - View system-wide notification statistics

### Automated Checks
- Daily overdue task scanning
- Upcoming deadline monitoring (today, tomorrow, 3 days)
- Attendance integration for missed clock-ins

## ðŸ”„ Integration Points

### Existing Systems
- Seamlessly integrated with existing task management
- Compatible with current user authentication
