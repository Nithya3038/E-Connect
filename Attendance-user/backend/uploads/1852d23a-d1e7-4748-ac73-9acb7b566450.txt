Editing Files (Client-Side Pre-processing):
Image Previews:
For image files, you can create a URL using URL.createObjectURL(file) to display a client-side preview before uploading.

Basic Image Manipulation:
Libraries like react-image-crop or react-avatar-editor can be used for client-side image cropping or resizing before upload.

Text File Editing:
For text files, you can read the file content using FileReader and display it in a textarea for editing.
