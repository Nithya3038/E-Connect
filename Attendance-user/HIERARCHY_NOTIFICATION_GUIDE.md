# Enhanced Hierarchy-based Task Completion Notifications

## Overview
The task completion notification system has been enhanced to implement a role-based hierarchy where notifications are sent to the appropriate authority based on who completed the task.

## Notification Flow

### üè¢ Hierarchy Structure
```
Employee (completes task) ‚Üí Manager (gets notified)
Manager (completes task) ‚Üí HR (gets notified)
```

### üìã Implementation Details

#### 1. Employee Task Completion
When an employee completes a task:
- **Recipient**: Their assigned manager
- **Message**: "Hi [Manager Name], [Employee Name] has completed the task '[Task Title]'. Please review the work."
- **Metadata**: Includes `notification_hierarchy: "employee_to_manager"`

#### 2. Manager Task Completion
When a manager completes a task:
- **Recipients**: All HR personnel in the system
- **Message**: "Hi [HR Name], Manager [Manager Name] has completed the task '[Task Title]'. Please review the work."
- **Metadata**: Includes `notification_hierarchy: "manager_to_hr"`

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Key Functions

#### `get_hr_users()`
Retrieves all users with HR role/department from the database.

```python
hr_users = get_hr_users()
# Returns list of HR users
```

#### `get_user_role(user_id)`
Determines the role of a user based on their position field.

```python
role = get_user_role(user_id)
# Returns: "manager", "hr", "employee", etc.
```

#### `create_task_completion_notification()`
Enhanced function that handles hierarchy-based notifications.

```python
notifications = await create_task_completion_notification(
    assignee_id=user_id,           # Who completed the task
    manager_id=manager_id,         # Manager (used for employee notifications)
    task_title="Task Title",
    assignee_name="User Name",
    task_id=task_id
)
```

### Database Schema
The notifications include enhanced metadata:

```json
{
    "title": "Task Completed",
    "message": "...",
    "notification_type": "task",
    "priority": "high",
    "action_url": "/admin/task",
    "related_id": "task_id",
    "metadata": {
        "task_title": "Task Title",
        "action": "Completed",
        "assignee_name": "User Name",
        "assignee_role": "Manager",
        "notification_hierarchy": "manager_to_hr"
    }
}
```

## üß™ Testing

### API Endpoint
Test the enhanced notifications using:
```
POST /tasks/test-notifications/{taskid}
```

### Manual Testing Script
Run the test script:
```bash
cd Attendance-user/backend
python test_hierarchy_notifications.py
```

### What Gets Tested
1. Employee task completion ‚Üí Manager notification
2. Manager task completion ‚Üí HR notification
3. HR user detection
4. Role detection accuracy

## üîÑ Integration

### Automatic Trigger
The enhanced notifications are automatically triggered when:
- Task status changes to "Completed", "Done", "completed", or "done"
- The system detects the role of the person completing the task
- Appropriate authority is notified based on hierarchy

### WebSocket Integration
All notifications are sent via WebSocket for real-time delivery to:
- Managers (for employee completions)
- HR personnel (for manager completions)

## üìä Monitoring

### Notification Types
- `notification_hierarchy: "employee_to_manager"`
- `notification_hierarchy: "manager_to_hr"`

### Filtering
You can filter notifications by:
- Hierarchy type
- Assignee role
- Notification priority
- Related task ID

## üéØ Benefits

1. **Clear Authority Chain**: Ensures proper escalation of task completions
2. **Role-based Logic**: Automatically determines who should be notified
3. **Multiple HR Support**: Notifies all HR personnel for manager completions
4. **Enhanced Tracking**: Better audit trail with hierarchy metadata
5. **Real-time Delivery**: Immediate WebSocket notifications
6. **Backward Compatible**: Works with existing task management system
